What is Steam? <a name="what-is-steam"></a>

Steam is the world's largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, created by Valve Corporation. Think of it as an "app store for PC games" where you can:

· Browse and purchase thousands of games
· Automatically install and update games
· Connect with friends
· Join gaming communities
· Access mods and user-generated content

Best part: The Steam client is completely free to download and use—you only pay for the games you want.
